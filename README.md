# Expense Tracker Web Application

This is a simple **Expense Tracker web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The app helps users track their income and expenses and shows the balance in real time.

I built this project to strengthen my frontend development fundamentals and to better understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic JavaScript logic.

For the design and overall layout, I took guidance from a YouTube tutorial by **Codesistency**.  
The purpose of following the tutorial was to learn the approach and structure, so that I can build similar projects independently in the future.

## ✨ Features
- Add income and expense transactions
- Automatic balance calculation
- Separate income and expense summary
- Clean and user-friendly interface
- Smooth UI interactions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Structure of the application  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Application logic and interactivity  

## 📌 Note
This project is part of my learning journey in frontend development.  
If you face any issues or have suggestions to improve this project, feel free to open an issue or share feedback.
